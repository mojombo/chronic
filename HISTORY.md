* Replace commas with spaces instead of removing the char (Thomas Walpole)
* Added tests for RepeaterSeason
* Re-factored tests. Now rather than having a test_parsing method for testing

  `2nd of May 1995`

* Fix RepeaterYear for fetching past year offsets when the current day is
  later than the last day of the same month in a past year (leap years) ie
  on 29th/feb (leap year) `last year` should (and now does) return 28th/feb
  instead of 1st/march
* Opt in for gem testing http://test.rubygems.org/

  just >1

# 0.4.2 / 2011-06-07

* Fix MonthRepeater for fetching past month offsets when current day is
  later than the last day of a past month (ie on 29th of March when parsing
  `last month` Chronic would return March instead of February. Now Chronic
  returns the last day of the past month)

# 0.4.1 / 2011-06-05

* Fix MiniDate ranges for parsing seasons (Thomas Walpole)

# 0.4.0 / 2011-06-04

* Seasons now ignore DST and return 00 as an hour
* Support parsing 2 digit years and added `ambiguous_year_future_bias` option
